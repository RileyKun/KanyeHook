## Leak of KanyeHook - Dated 4/6/24
We gave you multiple chances to show your actual worth as a coder. You instead showed pure immaturity and pure incompetence when it came to simple tasks and features that are trivial.  
You had more than 5 chances in various cheats and bases to prove your worth and you blew it on all of them, and instead now rage quit the community when the person you were wanting to collab with left. May we wish good riddance of you, Fourteen.

## Notes:
- The cheat is for the old 32-bit binaries (pre 64-bit)
- A lot of the code in this is either unoptimized or junk. There are STL asserts and crashes that will happen when compiled in debug mode.
- CL_Move is completely busted, have fun trying to use doubletap.
